                        <p>I am passionate and dedicated professional with a strong educational 
                            background in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. <br>
                            My journey into the world of web development began with a fascination for how websites 
                            work and a determination to create my own digital footprint. 
                            I am enthusiastic about creating responsive and intuitive websites that leave a lasting impression.I believe in the power of simplicity and clarity in design. I am on a mission to make the web a more accessible and visually appealing place.
                            <br> Every project I undertake is an opportunity for me to learn and improve, and I approach each task with dedication and a keen eye for detail.</p>
